As for himself he got ready his bow and\narrows and sitting at some distance in the posture of a hero he kept watch. Guha\ncalled his trusted watchmen and stationed them at different points with great\nlove; while he himself went and took his seat beside LakShmana with a quiver\nfastened to his waist and an arrow fitted to his bow. When the NiShada chief saw\nhis lord lying (on a bed of grass and leaves) he felt great sorrow in his heart\ndue to excess of love; the hair on his body bristled, tears flowed from his eyes\nand he addressed the following affectionate words to LakShmana: `The king's\npalace is naturally charming; even Indra's residence can hardly stand comparison\nwith it. Its beautiful atics are built of precious gems and are so lovely as\nthough the god of love has constructed them with his own hands.' (1-4)"

An adverse fate spares none. Do\nSita and the Hero of Raghu's race deserve to be exiled to the woods? They\nrightly say: `Fate is supreme.' (1-4)"

It is only when\nright understanding comes that the error of delusion disappears and then alone\none develops love for the feet of Shri Rama (the Lord of Raghus). O friend, the\nhighest spiritual goal is this: to be devoted to the feet of Shri Rama in\nthought, word and deed. Shri Rama is no other than Brahma (God), the supreme\nReality, unknown, imperceptible, beginningless, incomparable, free from all\nchange and beyond all diversity.
