        <h1><b>Overview</b></h1>
        <p>
            Puranas (/pʊˈrɑːnə/; Sanskrit: पुराण, purāṇa; literally meaning "ancient, old") are a vast genre of Hindu
            literature about a wide range of topics, particularly about legends and other traditional lore. The Puranas
            are known for the intricate layers of symbolism depicted within their stories. Composed originally in
            Sanskrit and in other Indian languages, several of these texts are named after major Hindu gods such as
            Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, and Adi Shakti.
            <br><br>
            The Puranic literature is encyclopedic, and it includes diverse topics such as cosmogony, cosmology,
            genealogies of gods, goddesses, kings, heroes, sages, and demigods, folk tales, pilgrimages, temples,
            medicine, astronomy, grammar, mineralogy, humor, love stories, as well as theology and philosophy. The
            content is highly inconsistent across the Puranas, and each Purana has survived in numerous manuscripts
            which are themselves inconsistent. The Hindu Maha Puranas are traditionally attributed to "Vyasa", but many
            scholars considered them likely the work of many authors over the centuries; in contrast, most Jaina Puranas
            can be dated and their authors assigned.
            <br><br>
            There are 18 Mukhya Puranas (Major Puranas), 18 Upa-Puranas (Minor Puranas or Major Upa-Puranas), and
            Ati-Puranas (Minor Upa-Puranas). The Puranas do not enjoy the authority of a
            scripture in Hinduism, but are considered as Smritis.
            <br><br>
            The Puranas, according to Flood, have traditionally been classified according to three qualities (guna)
            which are inherent in existence, namely the quality of light or purity (sattva), passion (rajas), and
            darkness or inertia (tamas), with each quality having six puranas focused, but not exclusively, upon a
            single deity.
            <br><br>
            The Upapuranas (Sanskrit: Upapurāṇa) are a genre of Hindu religious texts consisting of many compilations
            differentiated from the Mahapuranas by styling them as secondary Puranas using the prefix Upa (secondary).
            Though only a few of these compilations originated earlier than most of the extant Mahapuranas, some of
            these texts are extensive and important.
            <br><br>
            In spite of the mention of a particular Upapurana in different lists under different names, these lists
            provide us the names of much more than eighteen texts as the Upapuranas. In fact, by examining all the
            Sanskrit texts which mention the names of these texts, the actual number of the Upapuranas are found to be
            near a hundred, including those mentioned in the different lists. But, it cannot be denied that many of
            these texts have been lost without leaving any trace. <br>

                        from the Hindu epic Ramayana. The north Indian manuscripts of Padma Purana are very different
                        from south Indian versions, and the various recensions in both groups in different languages
                        (Devanagari and Bengali, for example) show major inconsistencies. Like the Skanda Purana, it is
                        a detailed treatise on travel and pilgrimage centers in India.

                        The Vayu Purana discusses its theories of cosmology, genealogy of gods and kings of solar and
                        lunar dynasties, mythology, geography, manvantaras, the solar system and the movements of the
                        celestial bodies. In addition to these,also discuss duties

                        for sannyasi (monks, yati), on dharma, on
                        sanskaras (rites of passage), and on the theory of hell in after-life.

                        Vayu and Vayaviya Puranas do share a very large overlap in their structure and contents,
                        possibly because they once were the same, but with continuous revisions over the centuries, the
                        original text became two different texts, and the Vayaviya text came also to be known as the
                        Brahmanda Purana.

                        The Vayu Purana, according to the tradition and verses in other Puranas, contains 24,000 verses
                        (shlokas). However, the surviving manuscripts have about 12,000 verses.
